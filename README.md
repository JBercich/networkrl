# ðŸš¦ Traffic Simulation Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

Using RL to optimise a simulated small-scale traffic system. This is initialy conducted in Python and then replicated in C++ to compare training times. If possible, training iterations of the simulation will be visualised in C++ to show how to chosen model works.

## Usage

Todo.
