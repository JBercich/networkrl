# ðŸš¦ Traffic Network MARL

## Overview

Using multi-agent RL to optimise a simulated small-scale traffic network. This is initialy conducted in Python and then replicated in C++ to compare training times. If possible, training iterations of the simulation will be visualised in C++ to show how the chosen model works.

## Usage

### Development

#### Python

To prepare a suitable python enviroment for development, this project uses `poetry` for package management. This can be instantiated easily noting that you need a python version of `^3.11`.

```bash
# From root project directory in ^3.11 environment
pip install poetry==1.4.0
poetry install --no-root --with dev
```
